## Key Functions

<br/>

We develop and execute marketing strategies to support the business growth in each stage of the funnel: 

 - Acquisition <br/>
- Conversion <br/>
- Retention <br/>

<br/>

The most important differentiator from a Marketing approach is that Growth builds a strategy that combines activities in the three stages of the funnel.

<br/>

TOFU (Top of the funnel): Analyze and optimize acquisition channels to increase qualified traffic to our website/ platform and work to optimize segmentation. Main KPI: Number of Qualified Leads.

<br/>

MOFU (Middle of the funnel): Nurture qualified leads in the pipeline and convert them into clients. Main KPI: % Conversion Rate & CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).

<br/>

BOFU (Bottom of the funnel): Increase MAU and retention by working with the Success Team to implement impacting campaigns to retain, activate and fidelize clients.

Key Performance Indicators: Percentage of Monthly Active Users (MAU) and LifeTime Value LTV
