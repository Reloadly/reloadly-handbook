<h1 id="what-are-okrs">What are OKRs?</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a> stand for Objectives and Key Results and are our quarterly objectives. OKRs are how to achieve the goal of the Key Performance Indicators <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator">KPIs</a>. They lay out our plan to execute our strategy and help make sure our goals and how to achieve that are clearly defined and aligned throughout the organization. </p>
<p>The Objectives help us understand what we&#39;re aiming to do, and the Key Results help paint the picture of how we&#39;ll measure success of the objective. You can use the phrase “We will achieve a certain OBJECTIVE as measured by the following KEY RESULTS…” to know if your OKR makes sense. The OKR methodology was pioneered by Andy Grove at Intel and has since helped align and transform companies around the world.</p>
<p>OKRs have four superpowers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus</li>
<li>Alignment</li>
<li>Tracking</li>
<li>Stretch</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="okrs-are-stretch-goals-by-default">OKRs are stretch goals by default</h2>

<p>OKRs should be ambitious but achievable. If you achieve less than 70% of your KR, it may have not been achievable. If you are regularly achieving 100% of your KRs, your goals may not be ambitious enough.
Some KRs will measure new approaches or processes in a quarter. When this happens, it can be difficult to determine what is ambitious and achievable because we lack experience with this kind of measurement. For these first iterations, we prefer to set goals that seem ambitious and expect a normal distribution of high, medium, and low achievement across teams with this KR.</p>

<h2 id="okrs-are-what-is-different">OKRs are what is different</h2>

<p>The OKRs are what initiatives we are focusing on this quarter specifically. Our most important work are things that happen every quarter. Things that happen every quarter are measured with Key Performance Indicators. Part of the OKRs will be or cause changes in KPIs.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-kpis">What are KPIs?</h2>
<p><br/>
Every part of Reloadly has Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) linked to the company OKRs. Avoid the term metric where we can be more explicit. Use KPI instead. A function may have many performance indicators (PIs) they track and not all of them will be KPIs. KPIs should be a subset of PIs and used to indicate the most important PIs to be surfaced to leadership.</p>

<p>The KPI definition should be in the most relevant part of the handbook which is organized by function and results. In the definition, it should mention what the canonical source is for this indicator. Where there are formulas, include those as well. Goals related to KPIs should co-exist with the definition. For example, &quot;Wider community contributions per release&quot; should be in the Community Relations part of the handbook and &quot;Average days to hire&quot; should be in the Talent Acquisition part of the handbook.</p>

<h2 id="target-dates-in-key-results">Target Dates in Key Results</h2>
<p>Just because quarters are a useful timeframe for objectives, does not mean that key results should default to being due on the last day of the quarter. This could lead to unnecessary delays. Consider putting specific target dates into the key result phrase to indicate when it is needed by.</p>
<p><br/>
You should decide your scoring methodology ahead of time. You might score an OKR as 0% if it misses its target date. Or, if it&#39;s less time sensitive, you might penalize it 10% for each week it&#39;s delayed.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-prioritize-okrs-in-the-light-of-other-priorities-">How do I prioritize OKRs in the light of other priorities?</h2>

<p>OKRs do not replace or supersede core team member responsibilities or performance indicators. OKRs are additive and are essentially a high signal request from your leadership team to prioritize the work. They typically are used to help galvanize the entire company or a set of teams to rapidly move in the one direction together. They are expected to be completed unless you have higher priority work that is surfaced and agreed to by leadership. When surfacing tradeoffs, team members should not factor in how an unmet OKR may impact your executive leadership bonus in their prioritization. They should instead focus on Reloadly priorities. If your executive leader still feels that the OKR is more important, they will ask you to <em>disagree and commit</em>.</p>

<h2 id="who-sets-okrs">Who sets OKRs?</h2>
<p><br/>
Generally, we do OKRs up to the team level. As a company, we do individual OKRs.</p>

<h2 id="okr-draft-review-meeting">OKR Draft Review Meeting</h2>

<p>Before the quarter starts, there is an OKR Draft Review Meeting for the executive group. This meeting is an opportunity for executives to get feedback from one another and highlight any dependencies on other functions to one another. </p>

<h2 id="making-changes-within-quarters">Making changes within quarters</h2>

<p>We value iteration. We can change an objective or KR if we find that in our pursuit of the initial KR we have not set the optimal goal. Here are a few examples of when this could happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>It becomes clear that the performance indicator does not provide the best measure for success</li>
<li>A KR statement exists, but the target is a placeholder. For example, &quot;Obtain $XM in bookings in Q1&quot;</li>
<li>A KR is related to achievement of a new initiative, and it is agreed that we should pivot in terms of scope or focus as we learn more about what we want to achieve</li>
</ol>

<p>Kindly note that iteration <strong>does not</strong> mean changing or lowering goal posts, because it looks like we can&#39;t meet what were ambitious but agreed upon key results.</p>
<p>It is better to update an objective or KR than continue to work toward a goal that is not best aligned with desired business results. In instances where CEO KRs are being updated in the spirit of iteration, post an MR in the <strong>#okrs</strong> Slack channel and tag the CEO and Chief of Staff to the CEO for approval. Approval of the MR indicates that the revised goal has been agreed upon. At this point, you can also update the issue or epic to reflect changes.</p>
<p>In the event that a functional Objective that is captured in an epic or a functional KR that is captured in an issue needs to be updated, please note the change in the <strong>#okrs</strong> Slack channel and tag the CEO and Chief of Staff to the CEO for approval. Approval of the change indicates that the revised goal has been agreed upon.</p>

<h1 id="format-of-objectives-and-key-results-in-epics-and-issues">Format of Objectives and Key Results in Epics and Issues</h1>

<p>Each functional epic should appear under the relevant CEO epic. Naming conventions are captured in the chart below.</p>

<p>This is the format for OKRs added as issues and epics.</p>

<ul>
<li>[EPIC] Title: Objective as a sentence.<ul>
<li>[ISSUE] Title KR: Key result</li>
<li>[ISSUE] Title KR: Key result</li>
<li>[ISSUE] Title KR: Key result</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, all OKR-related epics should follow the naming convention of &quot;Title: Objective as a sentence&quot;. </p>

<h2 id="scoring-okrs">Scoring OKRs</h2>

<p>We consider an objective done when 70-75% of its results have been achieved. If 100% of objectives results get done, it&#39;s not considered ambitious enough.
We use Google Sheets to manage our OKR process.  </p>
