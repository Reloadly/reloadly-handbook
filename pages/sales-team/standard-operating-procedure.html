    <h1 id="sales-operation-manual-standard-operating-procedure">Sales Operation Manual — Standard Operating Procedure</h1>
<p>This document describes the standard operating procedure for the sales team.</p>

<h1 id="sales-leads">Sales Leads</h1>

<p>Leads come from five main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic sign-ups online. <br/></li>
<li>Sales Development Representative (SDR) <br/></li>
<li>Industry contacts <br/></li>
<li>Conferences and other events <br/></li>
<li>Sales Navigator</li>
</ul>

<!-- <h2 id="sales-navigator">Sales Navigator</h2>

<p>Best Practices for Sales Navigator are in “Appendix X”</p> -->

<h2 id="pipedrive">Pipedrive</h2>

<p>All leads must be populated in Pipedrive before the end of the work week in which the lead was created. Everyone on the sales team must update the notes and status of all leads under their Pipedrive account each time there’s any activity. Of particular importance is ensuring that all leads are listed in the appropriate pipeline category and that the projections are up to date for each deal. Pipeline categories and definitions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Early Engagement. These are leads with which we’ve engaged in some sort of active dialogue and with whom we’ve already had at least one initial conversation.</li>
<li>Under Negotiation. These are leads who have, in principle, already expressed an interest in working with us and with whom we are only negotiating terms (i.e., pricing, SLAs, payment terms, FX, etc.)</li>
<li>In Integration. These are leads with whom we’ve already agreed commercial terms and they are actively engaged in integrating our services.</li>
<li>Live. These are accounts that have finished their integration process and are actively transacting. Even if integration is technically completed, new accounts are not considered “live” until they have transacted at least 25 non-test transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Reloadly’s sales team is focused on a consultative sales approach. Please refer to the latest sales training manual for further detail on this method.</p>

<h1 id="sales-reporting">Sales Reporting</h1>

<ol>
<li>Weekly sales reports will be generated every Monday.</li>
<li>The qualitative data will be populated automatically from the Finance Department</li>
<li><p>Reloadly’s Sales Teams and reporting are separated into five regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Americas (Caribbean, North, Central &amp; South America) <br/></li>
<li>Europe <br/></li>
<li>Asia Pacific (APAC) <br/></li>
<li>Middle East and North Africa (MENA) <br/></li>
<li>Africa (Sub-Saharan Africa) <br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Each regional General Manager or regional Sales Team lead needs to update the qualitative data each week, adding the relevant context to the performance metrics for the week prior in the “notes” section for each regional report.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="sales-meetings">Sales Meetings</h1>

<ol>
<li>There  are mandatory 15-minute Sales Team stand-up meetings every day for everyone on the sales team. If anyone cannot attend a daily meeting, a notice should be sent to the immediate line manager with the reason. </li>
<li>All meetings with external partners must be accompanied by meeting notes. These notes should be in the format “below/attached/in appendix N” and should be sent to the corresponding line manager the same day of the meeting (or the morning after if time does not permit).</li>
<li>Video images should be enabled for all video conference calls.</li>
<li>OKR reviews are conducted each week with the entire sales team. These calls focus on a review of the ongoing OKR tracker. Each person on the sales team is responsible for updating the quantitative data for their own KRI’s each week and present the qualitative background during our weekly group calls.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="account-management">Account Management</h1>

<ol>
<li>All accounts with the potential (per their Pipedrive profile) to generate more than $10,000 USD in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) must be contacted every month at a minimum.</li>
<li>All accounts with a minimum $10,000 MRR are required to have a formal quarterly review meeting. In-person quarterly account reviews should be suggested to the main account contact. If they do not want an in-person meeting, a video conference should be scheduled to review account performance, growth, potential and strategy.</li>
<li>The core questions to answer in all quarterly account reviews are
What is the true potential of this account?
Are they reaching that potential and, if not, what can we do differently to help them reach it?</li>
<li>Beyond the weekly reporting and quarterly account reviews, each account manager is responsible for keeping daily track of all accounts (with a minimum $10,000 MRR) and their transactions volumes. It’s good practice to log into “Admin” each morning (see platform tools section) and double check the transaction volume for the day prior for each of these accounts. </li>
<li>The Customer Success Team monitors all accounts continuously but the sales performance of each account is ultimately the responsibility of the corresponding Account Manager.</li>
<li>If any issue is identified, raise the concern first with the Customer Success Team and have them open a trouble ticket. A good customer experience does not require perfect platform performance but it does require that Reloadly identify and communicate any unexpected problems proactively. Outages and other issues will always happen. Our objective needs to be for our customers to never be the ones to notify us. We should always be the ones to communicate any issues to them.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="pricing">Pricing</h1>

<ol>
<li>Each regional GM is responsible for the pricing offered and set in each of the accounts in their own region.</li>
<li>Regional GMs have the authority to be as aggressive with pricing we need to be to win new accounts but may not approve any pricing proposal with negative margin without C-level approval</li>
<li>However, although each GM may approve their own pricing, only the group Finance Department may make changes to the rates or FX of any account.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="sales-bonuses">Sales Bonuses</h1>

<ol>
<li>Variable sales bonuses are paid quarterly for all relevant roles</li>
<li>The respective amounts and corresponding percentages may vary from role to role but the structure for these payments will remain constant.</li>
<li>Sales Bonuses are based on three criteria - number of new accounts live, Revenue against targets, and Gross Margin.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="number-of-new-accounts-live">Number of new accounts live</h3>
<p><br/>
This metric will be reflected by a fixed value paid per quarter for each qualifying account. The value paid for each account will also be tiered into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 Accounts. These are major accounts that transact more $100,000 MRR</li>
<li>Tier 2 Accounts. These are medium-sized accounts that transact between $50,000 and $100,000 MRR</li>
<li>Tier 3 Accounts. These are small accounts that transact between $10,000 and $50,000 MRR</li>
</ul>

<p>The account tier will be defined by the revenue generated by each account on the last month of each quarter</p>

<h3 id="revenue-against-targets">Revenue against targets</h3>

<p>This metric will be reflected as a percentage of regional sales volume performance against the projected quarterly sales budget. The minimum percentage to qualify for this metric is 70%. Anything below 70% will be equal to zero payout for this specific criteria.</p>

<h3 id="gross-margin">Gross Margin</h3>

<p>This metric will be a direct percentage of the total GM generated by all accounts each person manages. For example:</p>

<p>“Region A” has a regional sales goal of $1,000,000 USD for the quarter and an agreed value for “Criteria 1” of $1,000 at 100%</p>

<p>The agreed values for the various account tiers for that quarter are $1,000 for Tier 1 accounts, $500 for Tier 2 accounts and $250 for Tier 3 accounts.</p>

<p>The agreed percentage of GM is 1% </p>

<p>A member of the Sales Team in a region with the above metrics and agreed values has the following performance results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launched 1 “Tier 1” account and 2 “Tier 2” accounts</li>
<li>The region reached $1,200,000 in revenue for the quarter</li>
<li>The GM generated by all accounts this person managed was $60,000</li>
<li>The Bonus Paid in this example would be $3,800 USD for the quarter:<ul>
<li>$1,200 @ 120% of Criteria 1 <br/></li>
<li>$2,000 ($1,000 + $500 + $500) for Criteria 2 <br/></li>
<li>$600 @ 1% of $60,000 for Criteria 3 <br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
