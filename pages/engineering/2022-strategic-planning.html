            <p>We envision to put Reloadly and Engineering particularly on an accelerated path towards growth and efficiency. To that end, we would like to invest time and resources towards making systems more reliable, build newer tools and platforms to support business operations and make data driven decisions.</p>
            <p>Planned initiatives can be bucketed into following categories:</p>
            <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Strategic Initiatives</strong> - Initiatives that will impact Reloadly in the 3-5 year horizon. The ROI realization horization is longer for this category, but is critical towards our growth and sustainability.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Platform Improvements</strong> - Revamp existing technology platforms and systems and bring in new technologies that can support our intended growth posture. </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Process Improvements</strong> - These will help to better organize our internal processes and help ship faster.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Innovation</strong> - These will help differentiate Reloadly from competitors</p>
