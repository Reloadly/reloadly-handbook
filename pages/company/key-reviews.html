<h2 id="-purpose-"><strong>Purpose</strong></h2>
<p>For each executive — and some department leaders — to discuss the key metrics of that department in order to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make it much easier to stay up-to-date for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be accountable to the rest of the company.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Understand month-to-month variances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Understand performance against the plan, forecast and operating model.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure there is a tight connection between OKRs and KPIs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure that progress against OKRs is understood.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="-key-metrics-"><strong>Key Metrics</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><p>KPIs of that function or department.</p>
</li>
<li><p>OKRs for that function.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="-timing-"><strong>Timing</strong></h2>
<p>Meetings are scheduled monthly starting on the 15th day after month end. Slides should be shared in the slack channel #key-reviews 48hrs prior to the meeting date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="-scheduling-"><strong>Scheduling</strong></h2>
<p>The EBA is the scheduling DRI for the Monthly Key Reviews and will schedule no more than 2 Key Reviews on a given day. The Key Review meeting invitations will always be set to record.</p>
<p>A Key Review should not be cancelled; permission to cancel or make changes to the Key Review schedule must be requested in the #key-review Slack channel, tagging the CFO for approval and the EBA for awareness. If the CFO is not available, the CEO will make the decision. All changes to the Key Review schedule and/or invites have to be posted in the #key-review Slack channel.</p>
<p>Each month&#39;s Key Review schedule will be posted in the #key-review Slack channel on the first Monday of each month (if that Monday falls on a holiday it will be posted on the next business day).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="-invitees-"><strong>Invitees</strong></h2>
<p>Required invites are the CEO, the CFO, and the function head. Optional attendees are all other members of the executive group. The meetings are open to all team members who are interested. The meetings are also to be recorded via Zoom or Google Meets.</p>
<p>Functions that have these meetings are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regional General Managers (Enrique Herlimann - Function DRI) - scheduled quarterly</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quality &amp; Tech Support (Irene Paez - Function DRI) scheduled every other month</p>
</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="-meeting-format-"><strong>Meeting Format</strong></h2>
<p>There are three meeting formats. The preferred meeting format leverages Google Slides for their meetings. Some teams leverage Google Sheets and Docs </p>
<p>Important notes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Before every Key Review, the OKRs should be updated by the functional DRI by updating the Health Status of their KR issues and progress</p>
</li>
<li><p>A document will be linked from the calendar invite for participants to log questions or comments for discussion and to any additional track decisions &amp; action items.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Every department KPI should be covered. This can be in the presentation in the form of Google Sheets or Google Slides</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wherever possible, the KPI or KR being reviewed should be compared to Plan, Target, or industry benchmark.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no presentation; the meeting is purely Q&amp;A. Of course, people can ask to talk to them through a slide. If you want to present, please link that from the slide deck, agenda, to the  Slack channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The functional owner is responsible for updating and posting their Key Review agenda 24 hours in advance of the meeting, post in the #key-review Slack channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video is not required, but if there is a video it should be posted 24hrs in advance in the #key-review Slack channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The agenda document should include a presentation link that is accessible by all team members, as well as a Q&amp;A section.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the function DRI is not available to attend their Key Review then the function&#39;s leadership team is responsible for attending the meeting and providing updates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repetition in recognizing what is working or not working from month to month is okay as repetition can be an organizational tool for teaching people what’s important amidst all the noise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="-recordings-"><strong>Recordings</strong></h3>
<p>To view a recording of a Key Review, visit the playlist on YouTube titled Key Reviews. If you are unable to view a video, please ensure you are logged in as Reloadly’s youtube private channel.</p>
<p>Key Review recording links should be shared in the #key-review Slack channel by the functional department EBA within 24 hours of a Key Review being completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="-kpi-slides-"><strong>KPI Slides</strong></h3>
<p>Each group that presents has one markdown file with their KPIs. Every month, groups create an update to that markdown file. The following slides need to be updated with an monthly review:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Month on the first slide</p>
</li>
<li><p>Key Business Takeaways- should especially highlight any KPIs that need attention</p>
</li>
<li><p>OKR statuses</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="-google-slides-"><strong>Google Slides</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><p>The functional owner will prepare a google slide presentation with the content to be reviewed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The finance business partner assigned to the functional area will meet with the owner at least one week in advance and ensure that follow-ups from last meeting have been completed and that data to be presented has proper definitions and is derived from a Single Source of Truth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The finance business partner / preparer of the key review deck will ensure that the google slide permissions are set to comment for all in the  domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The title of every slide should be the key takeaway</p>
</li>
<li><p>A label on the slide should convey whether the metric result is &quot;on-track&quot; (green), &quot;needs improvement&quot; (yellow), or is an &quot;urgent concern&quot; (red).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Presentations should allow commenting from everyone at Reloadly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="-okr-slides-"><strong>OKR Slides</strong></h3>
<p>OKR slides should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recap top department OKRs and KRs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Link to the department epics</p>
</li>
<li><p>Share completion status and provide a health score</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flag key achievements</p>
</li>
<li><p>Highlight risks or dependencies in need of discussion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of each meeting, all attendees should be able to clearly answer what we are trying to achieve and whether we are on track. The Key Review immediately following the close of quarter should address not only new OKRs but also include an update on scoring of what we have achieved in the previous quarter.</p>
