<p><strong>OUR CORE VALUES</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW WE ACT</p>
<ol>
<li>100% transparency, No Shenanigans </li>
</ol>
<p>Transparency goes beyond honesty: we are straightforward. As a company we have an open agenda. We are at our best when we collaborate, cooperate, and collectively take decisions together at every level within our organisation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Act like owners</li>
</ol>
<p>Owners are  passionate, know their business inside and out. Owners take initiative and let their voices be heard. Owners sweat the details and “pick up the trash.” Owners think with vision and longevity, and go above and beyond to overcome challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW WE WIN</p>
<ol>
<li>Take initiatives</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no clear blueprint for success and instructions, it’s ours to write and figure it out. Build, ship, fix, improve and write it down.</p>
<ol>
<li>Shoot for the moon and don’t settle</li>
</ol>
<p>Always expect the best from yourself and others, aim high with precision and go for it! Don’t settle for mediocrity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t %#*! with the customer</li>
</ol>
<p>Our customers are our lifeline, we’re building products to delight customers and keep them happy. We listen, take notes and adjust based on customer demand and satisfaction.</p>
