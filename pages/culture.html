<h2 id="conduct">Conduct</h2>

<p>At Reloadly ,we believe in a set of practices, ethics, and behavior that all employees must adhere to. These standards of conduct are a set of norms that we expect from our employees to embrace behavior and culture. A professional code of conduct outlines appropriate actions for employees or members, as well as the legal consequences of breaking these rules. </p>
<p>To ensure orderly operations and provide the best possible work environment, Reloadly expects employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests and safety of all Team Members and the organization. The purpose of these rules is not to restrict your rights, but rather to be certain that you understand what conduct is expected and necessary. </p>
<p>Before detailing or expanding on specific behaviours which will lead to disciplinary action, let’s refresh and talk about our values and what we expect you to demonstrate.</p>

<h2 id="our-core-values">Our Core Values</h2>

<h3 id="how-we-act">How we act</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>100% transparency, No Shenanigans</strong>: Transparency goes beyond honesty - we are straightforward. As a company we have an open agenda. We are at our best when we collaborate, co-operate, and collectively take decisions together at every level within our organisation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Act like owners</strong>:  Owners are  passionate, know their business inside and out. Owners take initiative and let their voices be heard. Owners sweat the details and “pick up the trash.” Owners think with vision and longevity, and go above and beyond to overcome challenges. Other extended principles for acting like owners include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong>: Taking responsibility for our actions</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Keeps all sensitive information private and away from those who should not have access to it.</li>
<li><strong>Honesty</strong>: Always being truthful.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Having and demonstrating strong moral principles.</li>
<li><strong>Law-abiding</strong>: Follows all governing laws in the jurisdiction they perform.</li>
<li><strong>Loyalty</strong>: Remains committed to their profession and organisation.</li>
<li><strong>Objectivity</strong>: Not swayed or influenced by biases</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-we-win">How we win</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Take initiatives</strong>: There’s no clear blueprint for success and instructions, it’s ours to write and figure it out. Build, ship, fix, improve and write it down.</li>
<li><strong>Shoot for the moon and don’t settle</strong>:  Always expect the best from yourself and others, aim high with precision and go for it! Don’t settle for mediocrity.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t %#*! with the customer</strong>: Our customers are our lifeline, we’re building products to delight customers and keep them happy. We listen, take notes and adjust based on customer demand and satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-we-make-decisions">How we make decisions</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Think like a customer</strong>: Always ask why and start first  to understand the customer’s journey and pain points, only then can we truly build amazing products. Find innovative solutions to delight our users with big impact, come up with better ideas, and try new things.</li>
<li><strong>Obsessive prioritization</strong>: We are obsessed with high impact objectives, and to align our priorities with data driven decisions to impact  hyper growth for our company. Prioritization helps to breakdown complex problems, and provides clarity.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="demonstrating-values-and-ethical-behavior">Demonstrating values and ethical behavior</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Punctuality</strong>: If we have a meeting we have to organise ourselves in order to attend it on time.</li>
<li><strong>Working hours</strong>: If you are a full time employee, your working hours will be at least 8, from Monday to Friday. If you are a part time employee it will be 4 hours instead.</li>
<li><strong>Work schedule</strong>: We are flexible about everyone’s schedule while accomplishing with your daily working hours and adapt it to your meetings, calls, duties, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: It is compulsory to be available and reachable by your fellow employees and customers during your daily working hours. </li>
<li><strong>Meetings</strong>: We have to attend all the regular (or single) meetings in order to be updated and discuss any issue.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong>: Reloadly will offer and display training, new documentation updates, follow-up meetings according to the needs detected and so employees have to undertake them.</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>: We like and need to keep fluent communication. Slack is our basic and quickest way of communication so we have to set it up according to our appointments (so we don’t get interrupted) and be available during our working hours.  We also need to communicate clearly to our teammates, and unblock communication barriers.</li>
<li><strong>Video on</strong>: Nonverbal communication plays a significant role when communicating, it helps us to relate, engage, and establish meaningful interactions and deeper relationships. Most experts agree that 70 to 93 percent of all communication is nonverbal, we have to take advantage of it! During our video calls with customers we have to turn our video on to get the most of it. When meeting with colleagues it is needed to do it too (depends on every team’s agreement). </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="offsite">Offsite</h1>

<p>We have different kind of offsite meetings depending on who is attending.</p>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<p><br/>
Executive offsite: The off-site is a yearly meeting scheduled over 2-3 days (including travel time). Scheduling for the in-person event generally follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Travel Day: travel day with optional dinner around 7pm local time (usually Monday).</li>
<li>First Day: Full day meeting starting with breakfast at 8am (usually Tuesday)</li>
<li>Second Day: Full day meeting starting with breakfast at 8am. </li>
<li>Third Day: Half day meeting starting with breakfast at 8am. Usual end time is 12:30 pm with departure flights scheduled in the late afternoon (usually Thursday).</li>
</ol>

<p>Sales Acceleration offsite: The offsite is a yearly meeting scheduled over 2 days (not including travel time). It normally occurs at the end or beginning of the year. </p>

<h2 id="prep-work">Prep Work</h2>

<p>Because the offsite is a very expensive meeting, we want to be sure we are as efficient as possible. One of the ways we do this is by asking participants to do prep work ahead of time.
Examples of prep work include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading the content that was selected</li>
<li>Executives working with their HR Manager, CEO, COO or other C’s involved to prep the main points and issues that need to be tackled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who is presenting for a topic should share materials with the prep work.
Prep work should be shared at least one business day before.</p>

<h2 id="guidance-for-invited-participants">Guidance for invited participants</h2>

<p>There are a number of reasons why participants are invited to join specific offsite meetings. These can range from giving team members a chance for greater context to expecting an invited participant to lead a discussion. Before you attend the offsite, please:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand expectations for your participation</li>
<li>Ensure that you have context about what is being discussed. If you are invited to a meeting and don&#39;t have context, proactively start an async conversation or schedule a 15 minute meeting with the responsible and other participants. You should not need to attend a meeting without knowing what will be discussed or do any pre-work without clear direction</li>
<li>Don&#39;t spend hours preparing unless there is a direct ask to do so</li>
</ol>
