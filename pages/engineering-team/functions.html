    <h1 id="engineering-operation-manual-functions">Engineering Operation Manual — Functions</h1>
<p>This section describes the core functions of the engineering team.</p>
<h2 id="build-products">Build products</h2>
<p>The engineering team is responsible for developing software (and hardware where necessary) products for Reloadly&#39;s line of businesses: </p>
<ul>
<li>Airtime </li>
<li>Gift Cards</li>
<li>Utility Payments </li>
<li>Mobile Money (a future product)</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the long term business objectives at Reloadly, the leadership team identifies industry segments where Reloadly should have a presence. Business objectives are then defined for these segments and in turn get translated to product ideas and developed by the engineering team. The engineering team comes up with the effort and schedule for each development objective and begins the required software development project.</p>
<p>The engineering team controls the software sizing, deelopment, quality assurace, operations and maintenance of every software product created at Reloadly. They also work with the developer relations team to create customer(developer) facing products such as SDKs, widgets and educational material. In some cases, they work with third party consultants to achieve this.</p>

<h2 id="maintain-products">Maintain products</h2>
<p>Once a particular product (e.g Gift Cards) is built and rolled out to end users, the engineering team is responsible for its day-to-day maintenance. This involves bug fixes and updates to the product on a regular basis.</p>

<h2 id="integration-services">Integration services</h2>
<p>The engineering team is responsible for integrating Reloadly&#39;s infrastructure with providers of airtime, gift cards and utility bills.</p>

<h2 id="support-for-internal-tools">Support for internal tools</h2>
<p>Aides from building and maintaining core platforms and products, the engineering team supports a number of internal tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moesif: An analytics tracking and reporting tool used to visualize data generated by users of Reloadly&#39;s products.</li>
<li>Amplitude: A tool used to track analytics and provide visibility into user behaviour and marketing data for Reloadly&#39;s products</li>
<li>Metabase: A tool used to visualise business intelligence and analytics data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="provide-ad-hoc-support">Provide ad-hoc support</h2>
<p>The engineering team provides ad-hoc support to other parts of Reloadly. For example, the Finance or Customer Success team may need to gather key data and insights. In cases like this, the engineering team can assist in providing such data.</p>

<h2 id="investigate-customer-issues">Investigate customer issues</h2>
<p>In some cases, tools such as Moesif, Amplitude and Metabase are not sufficient enough to investigate specific customer technical issues. The engineering team helps with investigating such issues at the business team&#39;s request.</p>

<h2 id="maintain-and-operate-it-infrastructure">Maintain and operate IT infrastructure</h2>
<p>Reloadly&#39;s IT platforms and applications run on a variety of IT infrastructure which are hosted on cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), IBM Cloud and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The engineering team manages access to this infrastructure, fixes issues that may arise and maintains infrastructure overall. Below is a table of Reloadly&#39;s key infrastructure and their respective descriptions.</p>
