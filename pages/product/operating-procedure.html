<h2 id="product-development-flow">Product Development Flow</h2>
<p><img src="../images/product-development-flow.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="achieve-product-success-">Achieve product success.</h3>
<p>Reloadly Product managers take into consideration Quality and Quantity to approach and measure Product development success before, during, and after the product development Flow.</p>
<p>All decisions for the next product development are defined by different methods: Benchmarking, Users surveys, and product prototyping</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="feature-development-process">Feature Development Process</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="new-feature-development">New Feature Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>All new Feature development can be defined by CPO,PMs, or CTO/CAO.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Each new development must follow company objective. (ex. Increase MAUs)  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Once the concept is defined the process will be followed in the next stages:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="prds">PRDs</h3>
<p>PMs must define product requirements related to the project with Acceptance criteria, functional and non-functional requirements and UX/UI wireframes and prototypes.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>UX/UI designs requirements need to be defined by the designer, PMs and also Frontend developers if need it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="project-grooming">Project grooming</h3>
<p>Once all the requirements are defined, PMs and the Engineering team must define project complexity.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>Once the Backlog is groomed, defined and kicked off, PMs and the development team must assure to complete in the next sprint the stories related to the project focuses to release the minimum viable product.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>
<p>Development team along with QA engineer must verify product functionality before the feature is deployed to production. this will ensure that our deployments won&#39;t affect our current system and will ensure that the development achieves all product requirements and expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>
<p>The engineering team hand in hand with customer support and product will guarantee product stability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="providers-routes-integration-process">Providers/Routes Integration Process</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="prepaid-services">Prepaid Services</h3>
<p>Prepaid Service providers need to be defined and planned by the procurement/sales team and PMs. The following steps are used when integrating a provider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For each new provider,/route, a sales representative has to guarantee that the defined prices are negotiated and approved between Reloadly and the supplier/operator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each new provider/route integration needs to be prioritized in Integration boards by COO and PMs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once the technical integration starts, a communication channel must be established between all parties. this is to ensure that technical questions related to the integration can be clarified and developed in a short period of time. (Microsoft Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, Skype, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each integration must follow the Development stages: To-do → In progress → Code review → QA → Ready for PROD → Released.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the integration process is affected by some internal or external factor, all stakeholders related to the project must be informed in order to unblock the process and move forward with the integration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once the technical integration is completed, PMs must inform all stakeholders involved in the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>PMs and the finance team must set up standard pricing related to the provider/route integration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="design-process">Design Process</h2>
<p><img src="../images/product-design-process.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At Reloadly we follow a design thinking process. This is not a linear process, but a circular one. We can turn from Prototyping to POV or Ideate, from POV back to Understand and so on.</p>
<p>One of the first steps is to understand the problem. This includes conducting a competitive analysis and research. Designer and Project Manager look at what solutions to similar problems have been proposed and make an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors. Part of the research is also analyzing data from the current services, like retention.</p>
<p>As part of the Observation process, the Designer will conduct interviews in order to gather qualitative information directly from people engaged to Reloadly&#39;s products. The designer develops a script of questions, recruits participants and records the results. This is a way to get direct feedback from the current or potential users. The focus is on how to formulate effective questions and best interview practices.</p>
<p>After organizing the information, the Designer will proceed to persona creation. User persona helps us better understand user demographics, needs, goals, emotions, behaviors, fears, and limitations of our users. Then we map out user flows by using information architecture techniques like card sorting.</p>
<p>After mapping user flows, the Designer and the Product Manager brainstorm solutions for each task that the user needs to complete. Wireframes (blueprints initially) are created, as well as the first prototypes. Then we conduct usability tests. With the results, we go back to designing and then prototyping and then testing again.</p>
<p><img src="../images/product-design-iteration-2.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="bugs-reporting-and-fixes">Bugs reporting and fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Every Reloadly Team member must notify Product and Engineering team of any bug reported by a user or by another Reloadly team member.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Product and engineering team must create a ticket related to the bug to track the progress.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Fix will be communicated to stakeholders involved in the issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bug needs to be solved within the next 2h.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Engineering and Product team would prioritize these over BAU work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="qa-usability-testing">QA usability testing</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>All development QA must be performed using a staging environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All QA must follow a complete usability checklist.</p>

</li>
</ul>
