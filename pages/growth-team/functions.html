<p>This section describes the core functions of the growth team.</p>

<h2 id="key-functions">Key Functions</h2>

<p>We develop and execute marketing strategies to support the business growth in each stage of the funnel: </p>
<ul>
<li>Acquisition <br/><ul>
<li>Conversion <br/></li>
<li>Retention <br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important differentiator from a Marketing approach is that Growth builds a strategy that combines activities in the three stages of the funnel.</p>

<p>TOFU (Top of the funnel): Analyze and optimize acquisition channels to increase qualified traffic to our website/ platform and work to optimize segmentation. Main KPI: Number of Qualified Leads.</p>

<p>MOFU (Middle of the funnel): Nurture qualified leads in the pipeline and convert them into clients. Main KPI: % Conversion Rate &amp; CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).</p>

<p>BOFU (Bottom of the funnel): Increase MAU and retention by working with the Success Team to implement impacting campaigns to retain, activate and fidelize clients. </p>

<p>Key Performance Indicators: Percentage of Monthly Active Users (MAU) and LifeTime Value LTV</p>
