<p>WASH YOUR HANDS OFTEN</p>
<p>● Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,<br>especially after you’ve been in a public place, or after blowing<br>your nose, coughing, or sneezing.<br>● If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that<br>contains at least 60% alcohol.<br>● Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they<br>feel dry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AVOID TOUCHING YOUR FACE</p>
<p>● Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, especially with<br>unwashed hands.<br>● Your eyes, nose, and mouth are entryways for viruses into your<br>body. If you touch an infected surface and then touch your face<br>you could potentially become infected and get sick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WEAR A FACE COVERING</p>
<p>● Everyone should wear a mask while interacting with each other.<br>● While working from your desk and keeping distance from others it<br>is fine to not wear it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COVER COUGHS AND SNEEZES</p>
<p>● If you’re in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face<br>covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a<br>tissue when you cough or sneeze, or use the inside of your elbow.<br>● Throw used tissues in the trash.<br>● Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds.<br>If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a<br>hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING</p>
<p>● If you attend a meeting in person, be sure to keep one meter<br>distance with other people.<br>● If this social distancing isn&#39;t possible, or for further protection,<br>wear a mask.<br>● If you need to work near or talk to a co-worker, stay one meter far.<br>If you need to be in closer contact, wear a mask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PREVENTION AND ISOLATION</p>
<p>● To stay at home when you feel sick and think it may be COVID<br>● Communicate to the HR department and your manager ASAP<br>● Call to your doctor and get checked / PCR test and quarantine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
