<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="3-onboarding-performance-follow-up">3. ONBOARDING PERFORMANCE FOLLOW UP</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Before moving to everyone’s fulltime role, new employees need to close 5 tickets to be qualified</strong>.</p>
<p>After the onboarding process is completed, the new employee has a one-on-one with the HR team where their feedback and personal views of the onboarding and the company are sought after. Questions that are asked may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>How satisfied were you with the onboarding in general?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>The information given before arrival</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Who would you say is your knowledgeable point of contact in the company?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>What could have made your first day better?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How would you rate the preparation of manager? The team? Reloadly?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Is there any additional introduction and training for internal systems and general operating practices you feel you may need?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Are there any specific tools or training sessions that you think would help you be more successful?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Do you feel like you’ve received access to all of the information, tools, and resources you need to complete your responsibilities?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Is there anything missing?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>What would you like to accomplish in the next 30 days?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>If a friend of yours was going to start working with your organization, what would you tell them to expect during their first day and week?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Describe your onboarding process in one sentence</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How likely are you to recommend your organization as an employer after your first weeks on the job?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the new employee&#39;s first quarter at Reloadly, a monthly follow-up is conducted by the HR team - usually with the employee&#39;s manager. This is to ensure that the employee&#39;s initial expectations as well as other needs are being met. Discussions may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What’s going well so far? Describe some of your best experiences.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Is this role what you thought it would be? How has it differed from your initial expectations?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Are you experiencing any challenges in particular that we can assist you with?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Do you have enough time to do your work? Do you have too much or too little time?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How can I help you learn and improve? How can the organization support your growth and success?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Do you feel you have the information, tools, and resources you need to do your job successfully?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Are you comfortable asking questions about work? Who do you ask? Are there any introductions we can make?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Are you feeling comfortable within the organization in general? Do you feel like you have a good understanding of your role within the organization?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Is our organization’s mission clear, and do you see how your job supports that mission?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Do you have any suggestions for, or do you see any weaknesses in specific systems, processes, and procedures that the organization can improve?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
