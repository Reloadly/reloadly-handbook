<h2 id="corrective-discipline">Corrective Discipline</h2>
<p>All the types of conduct listed above can result in corrective action. Here we clarify some of these behaviours:</p>
<p><strong>Absenteeism</strong> is defined as unexcused absence. Such absenteeism is subject to corrective discipline. All leave must be pre-authorised by the Company. Taking leave without authorisation will be considered a gross misconduct offence. Taking leave despite a declined request will be considered a gross misconduct offence. Gross misconduct offences may result in dismissal without notice. </p>
<p><strong>Unexcused unavailability</strong> will be considered when somebody, during their working hours, can not be reached after several attempts and there is no fair justification. Any unavailability must be reported in advance and be approved. </p>
<p><strong>Failing to undergo training/meetings</strong> with no justification. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="warning-letters">Warning Letters</h2>
<p>When a employee does not accomplish with their duties or the behaviours listed or related to the ones above, their manager in line, CEO or HR will agree on sending a warning letter where to include the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Let  the employee know about the operational mistake:<br>If  the employee is new to the company, he may not be aware of the  mistake he is making. In this situation, it is of utter importance for you to tell your employee about it. Therefore, you should always start the warning letter by telling the employee in what way he has shown negligence of the duty.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Tell the employee about the warning letter:<br>When you write the warning letter to your employees for any reason, let them know that they should consider your letter as a warning letter. You should also tell the employee that he should not repeat the mistake to avoid serious consequences.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Mention the consequences:<br>To make the letter more effective, tell the employee about the potential consequences. For an operational mistake, you can fire the employee or you can make a deduction from his salary. No matter what you want to do, let the employee know that he will have to face the consequence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
