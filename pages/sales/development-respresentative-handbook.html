    <title>Sales Development Representative Handbook | Reloadly</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Sales Development Representative (SDR), you focus on outreach, prospecting, and lead qualification. To do so, you need to have an understanding of not only product and industry knowledge, but also sales soft skills, and internal tools and processes. This handbook page will act as a guide to those topics as well as general information about the SDR team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h1>
<p>In your first month at Reloadly we want to help ensure you have everything you need to be successful in your job. You will go through enablement videos, live sessions and activities covering a wide range of getting started topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="the-goal-of-sdr-onboarding">The Goal of SDR Onboarding</h3>
<p>As an SDR, you work closely with the marketing as well as the sales team. Due to this, your onboarding will encompass training on tools and processes related to not only your role but a blend of marketing and sales.</p>
<p>This learning experience involves virtual self-paced learning paths in the form of a general company-wide onboarding bootcamp, an SDR specific training, to prep you for your sales quick start. In parallel, you will meet regularly with your manager, onboarding buddy and members of our SDR enablement team to chat through and dig a bit deeper into the topics within your onboarding.</p>
<p>The goal in all of this is to ensure that you feel confident and comfortable to hit the ground running at the start of your second month on the job when you will have a ramped bonus. Our hope is that along this journey you are not only gaining the tactical skills needed to complete your job, but that you form connections with colleagues, gain a strong understanding of our culture, and begin to develop industry knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="sdr-onboarding-process">SDR Onboarding Process</h3>
<p>The People Team initiates a general Reloadly onboarding bootcamp for every new Reloadly team member. On your first day, you will receive a welcome email with steps to get started and invitations to your onboarding bootcamp training sessions. You will also meet with your manager.</p>
<p>You will receive an email giving you access to Pipedrive and specific training on how the SDR funnel works. </p>
<p>During your second week, you will ramp up your Pipedrive, Sales Navigator and SDR skills getting ready to land your first call. </p>
