<p><br/>
The HR department oversees the right balance between all employees&#39; wellbeing and the well running of the organization. In order to achieve it, a wide understanding of the company objectives, norms, procedures and policies have to be set.</p>

<p>Some of the duties that the department is in charge of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attracting candidates</strong> : This happens through employer branding, in which the company promotes itself in the job market. </li>
<li><strong>Selecting Candidates</strong>: To test how suitable candidates are for a job. Others department managers can be involved in the selection process.</li>
<li><strong>Onboarding and Offboarding employees</strong> : A good onboarding allows more of your new joiners to become productive in less time. Increase the quality of their initial work, setting a base for future performance improvements and higher retention. 
A positive offboarding process will leave a positive lasting impression, which will benefit the organisation&#39;s employer brand. It also creates a space for employees to feel comfortable returning to their role in the future. These are known as boomerang employees</li>
<li><strong>Performance Appraisals</strong> : Employees are tested to make sure that they will perform to the best of their ability in their new role.These appraisals facilitate communication between employee and manager, enhance the employee’s focus, help in setting professional and personal goals, improves performance, and help in determining training needs.</li>
<li><strong>Compensation &amp; promotions</strong> : Fair compensation. Compensation that is perceived as fair will motivate employees to do their best and to stay with the company. </li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefit Management</strong> : Creating the right benefits for employees is crucial in retaining key talent. By accommodating these needs, HR can create tremendous value for individual employees that leads to increased motivation, satisfaction, productivity, and retention.</li>
<li><strong>Learning &amp; Development</strong> : Learning and development activities as well as high-impact leadership development contribute to building relevant skills within the workforce. This involves upskilling the workforce in skills that align with organizational goals and the changing context of people’s jobs. Learning and development activities often align with employees’ personal development plans as well as with the core capabilities that the organization is building.</li>
<li><strong>Information Sharing</strong> : HR has a central place in sharing information with employees. This can be via emails, slack or newsletter to keep everyone up to date with the latest. It also entails work safety procedures, announcements of layoffs, mergers, or acquisitions, or any other impactful event that is relevant for employees. Clear, transparent, and timely information sharing is crucial in building and maintaining support and successful organizational change.</li>
<li><strong>Survey Management</strong> : The annual engagement survey is one of the most recognizable HR efforts in an organization. Surveying the attitudes of employees helps to understand where the organization is at, what the attitudes of employees are, and how productivity can be improved through better people management. </li>
<li><strong>Create and update policies</strong> : Policies need to be created first and keep them updated every year as the organization changes/grows. It’s HR’s job to make official updates to policies and to suggest changes to policies when they no longer serve the company or the employees.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain employee records</strong> : Maintaining HR records is mandated by law. These records help employers identify skill gaps to help with the hiring process and to analyze demographic data and comply with regulations. They also contain personal details and emergency contacts for each employee. </li>
