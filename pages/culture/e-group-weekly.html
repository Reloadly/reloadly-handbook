<p>The EBA to the CEO is responsible for scheduling these meetings. Head of People is responsible for managing the agenda and ensuring that meetings don&#39;t exceed the allocated time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="meeting-details">Meeting Details</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Before adding to the agenda on <a href="https://trello.com/b/8GhBq8Ft/weekly-exco">Trello Exco board</a>, E-Group members should consider whether topics are best suited for the meeting agenda or can be covered as FYIs in Slack</p>
</li>
<li><p>All agenda items including any pre-read material should be added to the Trello Board agenda by 5pm PT <em>1 business day</em> before the meeting unless something unexpected happens between the end of normal submissions and when the meeting occurs. If something unexpected occurs after this time, please add the topic at the bottom of the agenda and flag to E-Group in the #e-group or #e-group-confidential Slack channels</p>
</li>
<li><p>Submissions should include how much time would ideally be allocated for a specific topic</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Head of People will organize agenda suggestions and allocate discussion times by 3pm PT on the business day immediately before the meeting</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are inviting external folks to a specific session, please notify the EBA to the CEO at least two business days before the meeting</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure that any invited participants are clear about their role in the discussion</p>
</li>
<li><p>The CoS to the CEO will manage time within the meeting</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="agenda-structure">Agenda Structure</h2>
<p>The agenda for each E-Group Weekly has a single section for each meeting. Each agenda item should <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/suggested-agenda-format/#hallway">include a tag</a>. Three of the most often used tags are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>FYI: informational, no action needed</p>
</li>
<li><p>TODO: may not require significant discussion time, but there is an ask for all or a subset of E-Group team members</p>
</li>
<li><p>DISCUSS: cover in this meeting</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Head of People will order agenda topics. FYIs and TODOs will usually appear at the start of a meeting.</p>
